# Password Generator Starter Code

This week's Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.



## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br>
WHEN I answer each prompt<br>
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br>
WHEN all prompts are answered<br>
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br>
WHEN the password is generated<br>
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br>
